            <p>Maria Quitéria (1792–1853) was a Brazilian lieutenant and national heroine. She served in the Brazilian War of
                Independence in 1822–23 dressed as a man. She was promoted to cadet and Lieutenant and decorated with the
                Imperial order. She has been called "Brazilian Joan of Arc,"[1] and has become a kind of national legendary
                figure. Quitéria was the first woman to serve in a military unit in Brazil.</p>
            <p>Against her father's will, an unmarried Maria Quitéria enlisted in the Brazilian army, as a man, in October 1822.
                Until June 1823, she fought in several battles against the Portuguese in Bahia, where she lived. Maria Quitéria's
                father outed her as a woman once he discovered her betrayal—but because of her skill in battle, she was allowed
                to continue to fight. She was promoted to cadet in July 1823, and then to lieutenant in August, where she
                was received and decorated by the Emperor.</p>
            <p>Maria Quitéria de Jesus was born on June 27, 1792, in Licurizeiro, in the parish of São José das Itaporocas (now
                located in Feira de Santana), Bahia. She was the eldest daughter of a farmer, Gonçalo Alves de Almeida, and
                his wife, Quitéria Maria de Jesus.[5] Although Maria received no formal education, she would have practiced
                the skills necessary to farming, such as riding, hunting, and using firearms—these skills would serve her
                in the military as well.</p>

            <!-- Coluna 2-->
            <p>After her time serving in the war, Quitéria married Gabriel Pereira Brito (who was a former lover of hers) and
                had one daughter with him, named Luisa. A widowed Quitéria died in 1853 in relative obscurity and poverty
                near Salvador.[6] It was not until years later that her legacy was revived.</p>
            <p>After her death, Maria Quitéria was memorialized nationally in a number of ways. In 1953, one hundred years after
                her death, a bronze medal was issued by the military bearing Maria Quitéria's likeness. It is called the
                "Medal of Maria Quitéria" and was issued to both civilians and military personnel for valuable contributions
                to military efforts. By presidential decree in 1996, Maria Quitéria was proclaimed Patron of the Corps of
                Support Staff Officers of the Brazilian Army</p>
            <p>The best-known painting of Maria Quitéria is a work by Italian painter Domenico Failutti from 1920. She is depicted
                standing alone, holding a rifle and wearing the uniform of a Brazilian lieutenant. The work can be found
                in the Museu Paulista at the University of São Paulo.</p>

            <p>Ana Maria de Jesus Ribeiro di Garibaldi, best known as Anita Garibaldi (Portuguese: [ɐˈnitɐ ɡɐɾiˈbawdʒi], Italian:
                [aˈniːta ɡariˈbaldi]; August 30, 1821 – August 4, 1849) was the Brazilian wife and comrade-in-arms of Italian
                revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi. Their partnership epitomized the spirit of the 19th century's age of romanticism
                and revolutionary liberalism.</p>
